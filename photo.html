                        While the complex consists of at least four distinct squares (Durbar Square, Taumadhi Square, Dattatreya Square and Pottery Square), the whole area is informally known as the Bhakapur Durbar Square and is a highly visited site in the Kathmandu Valley.

                        Lke bhaktapur it is a UNESCO World Heritage Site.
                        The stupa itself is a symbol of enlightenment but at Boudhanath the symbolism is particularly clear.
                        Each different shape represents one of the five elements, earth, water, fire, air, and sphere, which are also the attributes of the five Buddhas.
                        Brought together in the form of the stupa, their unity reflects in abstract fashion the structure of the universe itself.

At an altitude of only 100 meters in some areas. Chitwan has a tropical monsoon climate, quite different than what you'd expect to find in Nepal.
                        Travelers come here to see wildlife. The park is home to rhinos, Bengal tigers, leopards, sloth bears, gaur (buffalo), deer, and many other critters. Freshwater dolphins (gangetic) and crocodiles inhabit the rivers and streams but are rarely seen. More than 500 species of birds make Chitwan a paradise for ornithologists. Tours from the lodges take you out into the park, either on foot, or more often, on elephants for close-up views of the animals.
                        It is included in the UNESCO list of world cultural heritage sites.
                        The best time to visit Chitwan is from October to February. Average temperatures hover around 25 degrees Celsius (77 degrees Fahrenheit), with high humidity.</p>

                        <i>everest trek</i>
                    </div>
                    <p>*  The summit of Mount Everest, the highest mountain on earth, reaches 8,848 meters (29,028 feet) high. Trekking in the Mount Everest area became popular following the now legendary first ascent of the peak in 1953 by Edmund Hillary from New Zealand and the Sherpa Tensing Norgay.
                        Since that time, many more have summited the mountain, but far more trek the route to Everest Base Camp simply for a glimpse of the peak far above.
                        The Everest Region is generally not regarded as the most scenic region in the country for trekking, but the allure of Everest makes it a popular destination, both for climbers and trekkers. There are various routes to access base camp and several options for organizing a trip.
                        Many trekking companies offer a guided hike, either with Nepalese companies or western-based companies. It's also possible to hire a private guide or porter and do it yourself, however all trekkers are technically required to have a guide. The main hiking seasons are in the spring and fall, from March to May and September to December.
                        For those not looking to trek to Mount Everest but still wanting to see the mountain, it is possible to see it on clear days from the hill town of Nagarkot near Kathmandu.

                    <p>*  Lumbini is famous for being the birthplace of Siddhartha Gautama, the historic Buddha, known as Buddha Shakyamuni. Situated off the main tourist track, almost 250 kilometers from Kathmandu, Lumbini is a worthwhile detour on the route from Pokhara to the Chitwan National Park.
                        In this pilgrimage town, a UNESCO World Heritage Site, there is a feeling of tranquility. Most of the visitors are Buddhist pilgrims from around the world, retracing Buddha's footsteps through the stations of his life.
